## Application description

This project is a mock-up/clone of Rotten Tomatoes.  It displays a list of movies on load with the ability to upvote or downvote a movie.  Clicking on the movie poster will load a movie details page about that movie.

This was our first application with all of the included technologies (React, Router, and Cypress).  One of the biggest challenges was the refactoring as it was written as a single page application in React first.  Then Router was installed and it was refactored to use Routing after Router was installed.  Some of our big wins were a nice refacator of the voting functionaity after Router was installed and having the "Home" button to only display on the Movie Details page and then be hidden on the main page.
